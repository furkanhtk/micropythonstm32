**Issue description**
Please describe the feature you'd like to see added to MicroPython. In particular, what does this feature enable and why is it useful.

For core Python language and library features please provide a link to the relevant PEP.

MicroPython aims to strike a balance between functionality and code size, so please consider whether this feature can be optionally enabled and whether it can be provided in other ways (e.g. pure-Python library).
