**Issue description**
Please describe the hardware feature you'd like to see supported by MicroPython.

For new architectures / ports / boards, please provide links to relevant documentation, specifications, and toolchains. Any information about the popularity and unique features about this hardware would also be useful.

For features for existing ports (e.g. new peripherals or microcontroller features), please describe which port(s) it applies too, and whether this is could be an extension to the machine API or a port-specific module?

For drivers (e.g. for external hardware), please link to datasheets and/or existing drivers from other sources.
